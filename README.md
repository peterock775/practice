Practicing web development
Hello! My name is Pete and Im currently learning how to be  a  design/web developer. I am commited to expanding my skill set in this profession because of my desire to become great. When I'm not developing,  I focus my attention on my hobbies which are boxing, day trading, and being in the outdoors.
